Java/Scala Test
===============

Design and implement a RESTful API (including data model and the backing implementation) for money transfers between accounts.

**Explicit  requirements**:

1. keep  it  simple  and  to  the  point  (e.g.  no  need  to  implement  any  authentication,  assume  the API is invoked  by  another internal  system/service)
2. use  whatever  frameworks/libraries  you  like  (except  Spring,  sorry!)  but  don't  forget  about  the requirement  #1
3. the  datastore  should  run  in-memory  for  the  sake  of  this  test
4. the  final  result  should  be  executable  as  a   standalone  program  (should  not require a pre-installed container/server)
5. demonstrate  with  tests  that  the  API  works  as  expected

**Implicit  requirements**:

1. the  code  produced  by  you  is  expected  to  be  of  high  quality.
2. there  are  no  detailed  requirements,  use  common  sense.

Please  put  your  work  on  github  or  bitbucket.
